    description: "Once your users have connected their third-party app accounts in the Connect Portal, you can access their app account via the Proxy API. The Proxy API allows you to directly access any of the third-party provider\x19s API methods. With the SDK, you can use paragon.request to send an API request to a third-party app on behalf of one of your Connected Users. Along with Workflows, the Proxy API is one of two primary ways to build integrations with Paragon."
